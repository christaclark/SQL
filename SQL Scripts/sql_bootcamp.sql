Title:  SQL Bootcamp
Author:  Cory Jez
Description:  This code is for a SQL Bootcamp.  It focuses much more on 
accessing data from a database rather than database administration.  This material
will be ideal for someonme using SQL as an analyst or developer in an organization
with a large data store. It assumes you have MySQL running and have 
downloaded the data repository here:

https://github.com/jezlax/SQL

Begin by connecting to MySQL via the Command Line Tool or your favorite GUI.
You can download MySQL Community Server and MySQL Workbench for free.

JOIN's come in. As the name suggests, JOIN's allow you to JOIN two (or more)
tables together.  There are several types of joins:
-INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
-LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from 
	the right table
-RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from 
	the left table
-FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
These have different use cases (please read more about them).  In our case, we
want to join the screen_resolutions table (with the ids and resolutions) to the
corresponding values in our user_logs table.  So, we want to LEFT JOIN 
screen_resolutions to user_logs based upon the matching resolution_id.

the JOIN between the two tables.  But you have to tell it what to join the two
tables on.  That's what the "ON" keyword does.  It means JOIN these two tables
when you see that resolution_id is the same for both.  I added the LIMIT 15
just to limit the output.
Looking at the output, it looks just like user_logs did previously, but with
the addition of two new columns: resolution_id and screen_resolution.  You'll
notice that resolution_id appears twice, once from the user_log table and once 
from the screen_resolutions table.  */
